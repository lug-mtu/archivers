Tools to grab archived LUG files

Please look at: http://trillian.lug.mtu.edu for a current view of the archived files. We will soon merge to https://lug.mtu.edu

## archive.org files
There are a lot of archived files in archive.org, such as the wiki, forum, livejournal, and mailing list. I only care about the mailing list itself for future reference. I would like to have a complete archive of all emails sent on lug-l@mtu.edu such as [NCSU's beautiful archive](https://lug.ncsu.edu/email-archive/), and this will get us 2001 to 2006. I believe 2001 is the earliest point where MTU LUG existed.

## Meeting minutes
Inside the wiki, there are meeting minutes from 2006 to 2012. Someone manually scraped those and saved them as PDFs. This is also important information.
